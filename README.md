# SCORE 2.x Playground
A demo site for SCORE component building and testing.

To run this:

1. Pull down the code locally.
2. Install Sitecore 8.1 into a "sandbox" directory as a sibling to the solution file.
3. Open the solution and allow nuget packages to restore.  If you open the Nuget Package Manager, SCORE should restore itself.
4. Place your license.xml into any unit test projects, and your SCORE.license into App_Data of your sandbox
5. Compile and deploy the solution.
